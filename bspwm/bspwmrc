# This one SXHKD doesn't exclude caps_lock key so we can create somewhat vim-like behaviour
# When caps_lock is active, you do your WM stuff
# This allows me to create even more easy-reachable hotkeys, without needing to have Super pressed all the time
# Also allows to use Super in emacs or whatever.
